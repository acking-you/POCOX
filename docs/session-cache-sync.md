# Controller history cache and synchronization v1

The controller App keeps history on disk and renders a bounded cached snapshot
before discovering or reconnecting to its host. The host remains authoritative.
After capability negotiation, history reads use content-verified deltas on the
existing meta service. Sending turns, resuming, taking ownership and answering
approvals keep their existing app-server paths.

## Boundaries

`SessionHistorySource: Send + Sync` is the extension boundary explicitly requested
for future history providers. Its only methods are `provider()` and the async
`read_window(&WindowQuery)`. A source supplies stable document IDs, their order,
opaque pagination metadata, and a source generation that changes on destructive
history updates. Reading must not take ownership or start model work.

The core protocol knows JSON documents and UTF-8 text; it has no Codex runtime
dependency. `CodexHistorySource` is the first production implementation. A second
provider fixture tests the HTTP protocol without Codex. Adding another production
provider requires its adapter and a client projection for that provider's document
schema; the current conversation UI explicitly negotiates `codex/app-server-v2`.

    Sync --> Meta[Existing meta HTTP service]
    Meta --> Trait[SessionHistorySource]
    Trait --> Codex[CodexHistorySource]
    Codex --> External[External codex app-server]
```

This adds a module to the existing meta service, without a new daemon or an
embedded model engine. The host stores only small bounded rollout scan indexes;
it does not retain a second transcript or a replay log for each controller.

## Wire contract

| Endpoint | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /history/v1/capabilities` | Version, provider schema, document limit, text-append support |
| `POST /history/v1/window` | Bounded query plus optional retained-content manifest; returns authoritative membership, changed documents and text suffixes |

Queries select a session, collection, optional group, opaque cursor, limit and
projection. The Codex adapter exposes `metadata`, `items` and `groups`. The normal
tail contains 20 items; the protocol permits at most 100 documents per window.
Existing turn-summary pagination remains available and is also synchronized.

The App fingerprints only documents it actually retains: the whole JSON document
and up to 128 large text fields per document, identified by JSON pointer, UTF-8
byte count and SHA-256. If the source still has that prefix, it sends a suffix and
a replacement template for other fields. A rewrite sends the changed document.
Unchanged documents have no body in the response. The response's order is
authoritative, including removals from that window.

The client verifies the old document, each reused text prefix and the reconstructed
document before atomically publishing the window and its pagination metadata.
Duplicate application is idempotent. Eviction or corruption produces a cache miss
and a bounded window fetch, without claiming an evicted synchronization base.

Generation changes discard other windows for that session, reject queued old live
checkpoints and invalidate in-flight pagination. The requested window is repaired;
other history loads only when requested. An invalid provider cursor returns HTTP
410 and requires reopening the session for a fresh bounded window. A failed read
never means end of history. During a replacement that races a multi-page read,
the normal history loader retries once rather than merging old and new pages.
The cumulative turn API also rejects its entire result if the generation changes
between pages, including when the provider still accepts the old cursor.

Only a 404 from the capability endpoint selects legacy behavior. Negotiation,
version, timeout or synchronization failures stay visible and do not silently
download whole history. On a new meta service backed by a legacy Codex thread,
Codex explicitly disallows `items/list`: that adapter projects a bounded window
from a host-local whole-history read. Remote transfer still uses deltas, but this
legacy path does not eliminate Codex's host-side whole-history parsing cost.

## Cache policy and UI

The cache lives at `<App support directory>/session-cache-v1`. Account/backend or
relay/key identity and the logical service identify a hashed namespace. Temporary
tunnel ports and expiring access tokens are not cache identities. Credentials are
not stored in cache files. On Unix, the directory is private and files use 0600.

```toml
[history_cache]
disk_limit_mb = 512
```

Settings exposes usage and capacity. The limit is shared by all hosts and sessions
in that App installation; zero disables persistence and evicts existing entries.
MB means 1,000,000 bytes. Accounting includes entry headers and staged replacement
file lengths. Filesystem allocation-unit overhead and directory metadata are not
included. In-memory snapshots retain their separate eight-thread / approximately
32 MiB budget.

Capacity changes and writes share the cache file lock. Writers read the current
configuration under that lock, so an outstanding network request cannot restore
files after persistence is disabled. Access-time updates use a write-capable file
handle on Windows; failure to update LRU metadata never deletes verified content.

Eviction removes individual windows or previews: current-session entries have
highest priority, recently refreshed running tails come next, then other entries
ordered by last access. Running priority has a 30-second lease, refreshed by
prefetch or live checkpoints, so vanished sessions cannot remain pinned forever.
Even a single active session cannot exceed the global budget. Writes reserve
space before staging and discard orphan staging files after a crash.

Already requested image-preview bytes share this budget. There is no automatic
attachment download; explicit downloads keep their separate destination and are
not evicted as cache. The App prefetches at most two running-session tails serially
per inventory poll, rotates through the running sessions, and skips the session
currently being read. Backgrounding stops new prefetch work; a request already in
flight may finish. Foregrounding resumes synchronization.

On startup or session opening, a disk snapshot appears with a cache/sync label.
Failure leaves it readable with explicit retry. Cached approvals cannot become
actionable; sending remains disabled until fresh state is loaded. Refresh preserves
the reading anchor when possible and drops windows from a superseded generation.
A legacy full follow snapshot completes synchronization just like a successful
paginated refresh, even while a previously issued paginated read is still pending.
Live snapshots are coalesced to roughly one second and final turn events, with at
most two ordinary checkpoint jobs per connection; app death can lose the latest
uncommitted snapshot, which the next delta repairs.

### Cached opening and reading gestures (2026-10-04)

```mermaid

    Open[Open conversation] --> View[Read saved snapshot and small live tail]
    View --> Local[Join retained pages of the same source generation]
    Local --> UI[Render cached history in the lazy transcript]
    Local --> Missing[Keep cursors at actual cache gaps]
    UI --> Sync[Reconcile the current server tail]
    Sync --> Overlap{Same generation and overlapping prefix?}
    Overlap -->|Yes| Keep[Keep cached prefix and fresh tail values]
    Overlap -->|No| Fresh[Use the fresh server window]
    Click[Tap load earlier] --> Page[Read next page]
    Scroll[Scroll toward a gap or past a short edge] --> Page
    Page -->|Explicit tap| Reveal[Reveal and briefly highlight new content]
    Page -->|Scrolling| Anchor[Preserve the visible message position]
```

Opening also reads retained ascending turn pages without requesting missing
windows. Their independent continuation cursors stay separate from the descending
tail cursor. A fresh source generation invalidates all of them; fresh tail values
win over cached duplicates. Older 100-item snapshots can recover their prefix
from the retained raw page chain without a cache migration.

Compact navigation follows the complete turn directory and loads an unloaded
target when selected. Dragging repositions it inside the transcript; layout
changes clamp it inside the available viewport. Mobile message presses animate
and highlight the target through menu dismissal, with reduced-motion support.
Local-session lists distinguish an unsupported mobile filesystem, a desktop with
no sessions, and a failed scan; remote host lists remain available on mobile.

### Anchored transcript (2026-10-17)

The transcript is laid out around a centre row: rows above it grow upward and
rows from it downward. A page or a gap filled above the reader therefore never
moves the visible message, and the end or a jumped-to turn is exact in the
frame it becomes the centre, whether or not the rows between were ever
measured. A jump also reads the turn or page just above its landing, which is
where the reader goes next; a turn whose pages are exhausted is not requested
again, and a monitoring refresh cannot reopen it. Only the in-flight request
marks history as loading, and only its own completion clears the mark.

### Deliberate limits

- Opening restores retained sequential pages and selected-turn windows locally,
  within the approximately 32 MiB materialized-history budget. Missing, evicted,
  mismatched or cyclic pages stop restoration at their real cursor. Very large
  sessions still page; the 512 MB disk quota does not imply 512 MB of rendered
  messages. The transcript remains lazy and independent windows keep their gaps.
- Live checkpoints retain at most 100 items separately from the full display
  snapshot, so streaming never reads or rewrites the entire restored history.
  Monitoring also writes only this bounded tail. Prefetch keeps an existing
  display snapshot and updates the raw tail. A successful full opening snapshot
  replaces the live checkpoint. This remains a
  disposable performance cache rather than a complete offline session archive.
- An individual cache entry is limited to 32 MiB. Larger responses remain usable
  online without persistence. Incoming decompressed synchronization responses are
  capped at 64 MiB; requests are capped at 512 KiB.
- Source indexes retain at most 256 rollouts and scan only appended records after
  initialization. Compaction records are streamed without retaining their large
  replacement text. Each scan stops at its initial file length and persists the
  complete-record prefix even if the writer appends concurrently. Later scans
  continue from that checkpoint; raced replacement or truncation is rejected.
  An evicted index may require rescanning its rollout.
- No migration of the existing in-memory cache or replacement of a running host
  is required. Old clients keep using the existing endpoints.

## Verification

The 2026-10-04 update passed workspace formatting and Clippy, 384 Rust tests
(10 opt-in tests ignored), and Flutter formatting/analyze plus 683 widget/unit
tests (3 opt-in tests skipped). The bridge suite was rerun after the final cache
write-path change: 106 passed, 6 opt-in tests ignored. Regression cases include
retained descending/ascending pages, legacy snapshots, missing and cyclic cursors,
generation replacement, bounded live writes, cached first paint, short-page edge
paging, explicit reveal, passive anchoring, dragging across resize, and press
cancellation/menu dismissal. Phone, tablet and desktop layouts cover both themes.
These checks do not substitute for touch testing on the user's physical phone.

Verification in the isolated development worktree on 2026-09-25:

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| First-party Rust formatting and workspace Clippy (`-D warnings`) | Passed |
| `cargo test --workspace --locked` | 345 passed, 8 opt-in tests ignored |
| Real Codex history test, explicitly enabled | 1 passed; included among the 8 normally ignored tests above |
| Flutter dependency resolution, formatting and analysis | Passed |
| `flutter test` | 523 passed, 3 skipped |

Protocol tests cover unchanged windows, UTF-8 suffixes, rewrites, removals,
generation replacement, missing/corrupt bases and duplicate response application.
Disk tests cover restart reuse, namespaces, eviction, torn writes, orphan staging
files and quota reduction. Pagination tests reject pre-replacement work. Widget
tests exercise cached first paint at phone, tablet and desktop widths in light and
dark themes, stale-state send blocking, and foreground prefetch scheduling.
Review regressions cover concurrent append during initial indexing, partial records,
replacement during scanning, quota changes observed by outstanding cache handles,
nonfatal access-time failures, cumulative reads crossing a generation change, and
legacy follow snapshots completing synchronization. Validation ran on Linux;
Windows timestamp access was checked against Rust's Windows implementation and
the [SetFileTime access requirement](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-setfiletime),
without a native Windows test run.

The opt-in test creates a separate external app-server with temporary Codex home,
working directory, source index, controller cache and random loopback ports. It
uses synthetic history and makes no model request or connection to a running user
host:

```bash
POCOX_TEST_CODEX_BINARY=/absolute/path/to/native/codex \
  cargo test -p pocox-host-svc --locked --test history_sync_codex \
  -- --ignored --nocapture
```

With a 1,000,000-byte assistant message, the observed response JSON sizes were
1,000,894 bytes cold, 300 bytes after recreating the meta adapter and reloading the
client's disk base, and 932 bytes when another turn was appended. These measure
decompressed JSON payloads, not compressed network bytes or mobile latency. The
separate protocol suffix test verifies appending within a large existing message.
The real-runtime fixture exercises legacy history; pagination is covered by the
existing bridge protocol tests. Live relay and mobile-device latency have not been
benchmarked by these tests.

## Live retention and write accounting

The connection's live transcript is separate from the paginated history cache. It
retains at most eight threads, 1024 items and approximately 32 MiB of item allocations.
Item IDs index incremental updates; restoration clones at most a 100-item tail.
Eviction never interrupts event delivery or approval tracking. After eviction,
missing items require a full snapshot to enter this cache again, preventing a late
text suffix from being persisted as a complete message prefix. Completed history
continues to come from the host's ordinary paginated APIs.

Disk writes reuse a process-local byte count while a lock-file revision and directory
mtime still match. Writers invalidate the revision before mutation under the existing
OS file lock. A process crash, another writer, an orphan staging file, or a cold cache
rebuilds accounting; explicit usage diagnostics reconcile it as well. Header reads and
LRU sorting happen only when the quota requires eviction. Both old and staged data
still count against the quota, and atomic data/manifest writes retain their file and
directory syncs.

Run the opt-in filesystem benchmark with:

```sh
cargo test --locked -p pocox_bridge benchmark_cache_rewrites -- --ignored --nocapture
```
