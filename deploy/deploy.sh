# Install/upgrade the POCOX hosted backend on a Linux server.

# the firewall — see the printed next steps (and deploy/README.md).
#
# Usage:
#   sudo ./deploy.sh /path/to/pocket-codex-backend          # install a prebuilt binary
#   sudo ./deploy.sh --build /path/to/pocket-codex-repo      # build from source then install

# Two paths, in order, because the key moved in pb-mapper 0.5:
#   - 0.5+: /var/lib/pb-mapper/auth/admin.key   (the root of the derivation)
#   - 0.2 : /var/lib/pb-mapper-server/msg_header_key  (the old shared key)
#
# The 0.5 file is 0600 root, and the backend runs as the unprivileged `pcx`, so
# it cannot read it directly — the key is copied into the 0600 pcx-owned
# backend.env instead. That is a deliberate second copy: the alternative is
# loosening the relay's own key file, which would expose it to every local user.
#
# An install upgraded from 0.2 may already carry the OLD key in backend.env. It
# is replaced when the two differ, because a stale shared key fails every admin
# RPC — and the failure surfaces as "issuing a relay credential" errors on
# /v1/relay rather than anything that names the key.
