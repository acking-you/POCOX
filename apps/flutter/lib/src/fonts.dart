/// Font configuration.
///
/// The design system is set in Google Sans Flex (prose) and Geist Mono
/// (code), both bundled on every platform — see the `fonts:` block in
/// pubspec.yaml. Neither face carries a single CJK glyph, so Chinese never
/// renders *from* them: it resolves down the fallback chains below.
///
/// Chinese rendered with Flutter's default (no declared CJK font) looks thin
/// and unevenly weighted on Windows, because the OS picks a fallback face per
/// glyph-run. To fix it we bundle Noto Sans SC — but ONLY in the desktop builds
/// (Windows/macOS/Linux), which is where the problem is. Mobile (Android/iOS)
/// keeps the OS CJK fonts (PingFang SC / Noto Sans CJK SC), which already
/// render Chinese well, so those artifacts don't carry the ~17 MB.
///
/// Desktop bundling is done by swapping `pubspec-desktop.yaml` (which adds a
/// `fonts:` entry for the family below) over `pubspec.yaml` before the build —
/// see the desktop jobs in .github/workflows/release.yml and the note in
/// AGENTS.md. The default `pubspec.yaml` omits it, so mobile/test never bundle
/// it — which is why [cjkFontFallback] can't name it unconditionally.

/// antialiasing rather than ClearType, and at 13–15 px on a 100%/125% display
