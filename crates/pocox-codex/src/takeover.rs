//! Combine a session's transcript state ([`crate::rollout`]) with its
//! liveness ([`crate::liveness`]) into a single resume-safety verdict,
//! and implement *force takeover*: evicting whatever live process holds a
//! session's rollout open so POCOX's own app-server can resume it.
//!
//! ## Why a force takeover exists
//!
//! Resuming a thread appends to its existing rollout file. If a second
//! process (e.g. the desktop app) still has that thread loaded, both
//! would append to one file and diverge — so a resume is only safe when
//! no live process owns the session. The clean cases ([`ResumeSafety`])
//! cover that. But a user may *knowingly* want to pull a session that the
//! desktop app still holds onto their phone; for that, [`force_release`]
//! attempts to terminate the holders first. A surviving or respawned
//! holder blocks the subsequent resume. Confirmation authorizes releasing
//! an idle owner, not adding a second writer when that release fails.
