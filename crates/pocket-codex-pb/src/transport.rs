//! Which relay to talk to, with which credential, and under which key
//! namespace.
//!
//! ```text
//!   signed in?  ─yes─▶ account:   credential from the backend's `/v1/relay`,
//!         │                       keys under `pcxu:<user>:`
//!         │ no
//!         ▼
//!                      self-host: the operator's own relay and key, `pcx:` keys
//! ```
//!
//! # Why this type exists
//!
//! Account mode used to be a wholly separate implementation: its bytes went
//! through the backend's broker, so every subscribe, probe, and register had an
//! account-shaped variant beside its self-host one. With clients reaching the
//! relay directly the two differ in exactly two values — the credential and
//! whether keys carry an account namespace — so both collapse into this one
//! type and every caller downstream has a single path.
//!
//! It also replaced `apply_key`, which installed the relay key into a
//! PROCESS-GLOBAL before each call. The credential is a value here, so nothing
//! ambient has to be set up first and two sessions can coexist.
//!
//! # Resolution lives with the caller
//!
//! The CLI reads a `Config` it was handed; the app reads its support directory
//! and may fetch a credential over HTTP. Those have nothing in common but their
//! result, so each builds its own `Transport` and only the key logic — the part
//! that MUST agree between them — is here.
