//! # Why the credential is a parameter now
//!
//! This module used to call `set_process_msg_header_key`, a process-global
//! mutation, and every entrypoint relied on it having happened first. That made
//! the relay's shared key ambient state in whatever process wanted to tunnel —
//! including the Flutter app's bridge. The SDK's credential is per-[`Client`]
//! instead, so it travels as an argument and two sessions in one process may
//! hold different credentials. That is what lets the backend keep the admin key
//! while a client only ever holds a short-lived issued one.
//!
//! # Registrations are handles, not futures
//!
//! `register`/`subscribe` used to return a future that ran until the session
//! died, so callers `tokio::spawn`ed it and had no way to ask whether the
//! tunnel was actually up. The SDK spawns its own worker and hands back a
//! handle carrying readiness and a `stop()`. We surface that handle so a caller
//! can wait for the relay to accept the registration and tear it down
//! deliberately — dropping it aborts the tunnel.
