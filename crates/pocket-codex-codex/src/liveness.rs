//! Detect whether a session's rollout file is currently *owned by a live
//! process*, so POCOX never resumes a thread another codex client
//! (e.g. the desktop app) still has loaded.
//!
//! codex keeps a rollout file open for the whole time a thread is loaded
//! — including while it sits idle awaiting the next user input, not just
//! while a turn runs. So "is this rollout held open?" answers the real
//! ownership question: a `task_complete` in the transcript means the
//! *turn* finished, but if the file is still held open the owning process
//! could start a new turn at any moment, and resuming it from a second
//! app-server would make two writers append to one rollout. See
//! [`crate::takeover`] for how this combines with [`crate::rollout`].
//!
//! ## Platform strategy
//!
//! * **Windows** — there is no advisory lock, but a process holding the file
//!   open prevents a *no-sharing* (`share_mode(0)`) open by anyone else, so
//!   [`is_held_open`] probes that directly. Naming the exact holder PID would
//!   need the Restart Manager FFI, which this `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` crate
//!   avoids, so [`file_holders`] returns nothing there and [`crate::takeover`]
//!   falls back to the codex app-server candidate pool from
//!   [`codex_app_server_processes`].
//! * **Unix** — opening never reports a sharing violation, so liveness is
//!   derived from `lsof`, which also yields the exact holder PIDs.
