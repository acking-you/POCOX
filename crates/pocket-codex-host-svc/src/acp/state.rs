//! The host's authoritative state for one agent: generation, phase,
//! admitted sessions, running and recently finished turns, pending
//! permissions, retained transcripts and the sequenced event log.
//!
//! Every mutation happens under one lock together with the event it emits,
//! so a snapshot (state + last sequence number) and the events after it are
//! always consistent: a controller that reads the snapshot and then streams
//! from its sequence watermark sees every later change exactly once. A
//! history read carries the same watermark, so a controller can rebuild a
//! turn's fold and apply exactly the events that follow it.
//!
//! The generation increases whenever an agent process starts and whenever a
//! running one is invalidated. Work started under an older generation (a
//! prompt task, a reader callback) checks it before writing and is dropped
//! when it no longer matches, so a replaced process can never emit into its
//! successor.
//!
//! A session being reopened (`session/load` or `session/resume`) is
//! *pending*: it accepts no prompt and grants no file authority until the
//! agent confirmed the reopen.
