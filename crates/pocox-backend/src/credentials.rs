//! Per-account relay credentials: minted under the backend's administrator key,
//! handed to clients so they can reach the relay without the backend in the
//! way.
//!
//! ```text
//!   client ──JWT──▶ backend ──admin key──▶ relay      (once per TTL)
//!          ◀── pbmt1_… ──┘
//!   client ─────────── pbmt1_… ───────────▶ relay      (every byte after)
//! ```
//!
//! # One credential per account
//!
//! A temporary credential's namespace IS its key id, and namespaces are hard
//! isolation. Minting per DEVICE would put an account's phone and desktop in
//! different namespaces, unable to see each other's services — which is the
//! product. So every device on an account gets the SAME credential, and the
//! isolation boundary sits between accounts, where it belongs.
//!
//! # Why cache
//!
//! The relay's key table is finite (65,536 slots by default) and every issue
//! consumes one until it expires. Minting per request would exhaust it under
//! ordinary polling, so an account's credential is minted once, renewed while
//! it is still valid, and only re-minted once it cannot be.
