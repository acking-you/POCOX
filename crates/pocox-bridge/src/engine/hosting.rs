//! Instance-name claims shared by every hosted provider.
//!
//! One instance name maps to one `meta:<name>` service on a device, so a name
//! can serve only one provider at a time. Every provider claims its name in
//! this one table before starting anything, so two providers can never both
//! pass the check and start under the same name:
//!
//! - Codex holds a [`Claim`] for the duration of its start; after it the native
//!   host table proves ownership (checked by [`reserve`]). Concurrent starts of
//!   the *same* provider share the claim, keeping their existing reuse
//!   behaviour.
//! - ACP holds an exclusive [`Reservation`] from startup until its stop has
//!   finished; a failed or abandoned startup releases it on drop.
//! - A Codex stop holds a claim ([`retiring`]) from before the host leaves its
//!   table until its relay keys and listeners are released.
//!
//! Lock order: the claim table may be held while a provider's host table is
//! read (in [`reserve`]), never the other way round.
