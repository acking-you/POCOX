//! JSON bodies for the backend's HTTP API (served over HTTPS).
//!
//! Auth is GitHub login — Device Flow or the browser-redirect flow — mediated
//! by the backend, which holds the OAuth client secret. `start` returns a user
//! code and a verification URL, the client polls until the backend has a
//! session, then uses the bearer token for every `/v1/*` call.
//!
//! [`RelayCredentialResponse`] is where a client stops needing the backend: it
//! carries the relay address and a credential, and everything after it is
//! client↔relay.
