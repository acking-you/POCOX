//! How the app resolves its [`Transport`] from persisted configuration.
//!
//! ```text
//!   signed in?  ─yes─▶ account:   GET /v1/relay, keys under `pcxu:<user>:`
//!         │ no
//!         ▼
//!                      self-host: configured relay + stored key, `pcx:` keys
//! ```
//!
//! The type itself, and the key-shape rules that must hold identically here and
//! in the CLI, live in [`pocket_codex_pb::transport`]. This module is only the
//! app's half: reading the support directory and, in account mode, fetching and
//! refreshing a credential. The CLI resolves the same type from flags instead.
//!
//! # Context identity
//!
//! The same logical `pcx:` key names different services under different
//! accounts or self-host relays. [`Context`] identifies *which* network a
//! transport reaches — account namespace and relay in account mode, relay and
//! a fingerprint of its key in self-host mode — without the credential
//! itself, so a refreshed account credential keeps the same context. Every
//! resolution records the current context; when it changes (or the
//! configuration changes), state owned by the previous context is dropped.
//!
//! Owned state is the ACP connection registry and the context-scoped meta
//! tunnels. One revision, the [`epoch`], orders all of it:
//!
//! - A resolution captures the epoch *before* it reads the configuration and
//!   commits ([`Owned`]) only if the epoch is unchanged when it is observed —
//!   checked and installed under the same lock that [`context_changed`] takes,
//!   so a resolution that read the previous configuration can neither become
//!   current, nor touch the credential refresher, nor drop the newer context's
//!   state. It then simply resolves again from the new configuration.
//! - The epoch moves (under that lock) *before* owned state is dropped.
//! - Work that outlives its resolution (a connection being established, a
//!   tunnel being opened) carries the [`Owned::epoch`] it was resolved at and
//!   registers only while the epoch is unchanged, checked under the lock of the
//!   registry it registers in. Such work either registers before the drop (and
//!   is dropped with it) or sees the change and backs out.
//!
//! An account transport is built from one credential answer (relay,
//! credential and namespace together), never from two separate reads that
//! an account switch could interleave.
